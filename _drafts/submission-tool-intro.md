If you've submitted data to BCO-DMO before, you might be familiar with the process: download a metadata .rtf form, fill in all of the relevant details, save the file, and attach it to an email to info@bco-dmo.org along with your data files. This process has served us and our community well, but we also realize there are occasionally challenges encountered when submitting data this way. Sometimes, the .rtf form may be difficult to work with in certain word processing programs, or perhaps you started to fill in a form and forgot to save it! (we've all made this mistake). Other times, email clients may have trouble sending messages with attachments. Over time, after many research projects and many data submissions, it may even become difficult for you to keep track of what data you've submitted to BCO-DMO. We understand things sometimes have a way of getting lost in email inboxesâ€¦

To help streamline the process, we are pleased to announce the release of our new online submission tool! This tool is an online interface you can access in your browser directly at https://submit.bco-dmo.org/. It provides many features that we hope create a better user experience for data submission, including the ability to save your progress,  and check the status of your submissions. If the old process is working well for you, you can continue to submit data by email, but we encourage you to try out the new tool to see if it improves your workflow. (Please share any feedback you have to [feedback@bco-dmo.org (?)]

In upcoming blog posts, we'll explore the features of the online submission tool in more detail, providing step-by-step how-tos. However, the tool has plenty of built-in instructions and guidance that should make it intuitive for you to use on your next submission. To get you started, here are some basics:
* When you land at https://submit.bco-dmo.org/, you'll be prompted to login with your ORCiD. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up at https://orcid.org/.
* Once logged in, you'll see two options: "Create a new dataset" and "Register a new project" (Yes, you can register projects using this tool, too!)
* After selecting one of those options, you'll be guided through a series of metadata fields where you can enter the relevant information.
* On the last step, you upload your files and hit "Submit"!
* Once submitted, you'll receive an automated confirmation email. Soon after, a BCO-DMO data manager will review your submission and provide further details by email on the next steps.
