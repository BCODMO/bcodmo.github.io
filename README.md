## Publishing a Post

1. Decide which [category](#post-metadata-category) is the best fit. One of: [`news`, `data-tools`, `insights`, `engineering`]
2. Rename the post to `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-<desired-url-goes-here-using-dashes>.md` (NOTE: `_drafts` was replaced by `_posts`
3. Save post
4. Create a new [Release](https://github.com/BCODMO/blog.bco-dmo.org/releases/new)
    1. `v(x).0` where `(x)` is incremented from the previous blog version number. For example, if the current version of the blog is `v1.0`, set release version to `v2.0`
    2. Set the `Release Title` to the title of your post.
    3. Click `Publish Release`
    
<a name="q_why-releases"></a>
__Q: Why do we need to publish releases?__

`Releases help us preserve the state of the blog so that if for any reason, we can recapture content at certain important points in the history of the blog. THis helps us mitigate unforeseen circumstances where content is accidentally deleted or moved.`
 
6. Ensure the blog was [successfully built](https://github.com/BCODMO/blog.bco-dmo.org/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages)
