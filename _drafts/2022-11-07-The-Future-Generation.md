Ever wonder what happens to your data after you submit them to BCO-DMO? The general workflow looks like this: researchers submit their project-specific data, we (BCO-DMO data managers) communicate with the submitters, we curate the data (ensuring their format and associated metadata are comprehensible and easily reusable), and — finally — we publish it online.

As a data manager, I have pushed hundreds of datasets through this general flow. However, it is rare that we are directly involved in the next step, which is reusing our data holdings. It is up to the public and the research community to complete the whole reuse cycle and actually **use** these curated data. 

But once in a while, a magical opportunity comes along that triggers our wildest ideas in helping to motivate and encourage others to complete that last step in the data life cycle. (Don't let the unassuming term "data manager" deceive you; we have lots of ideas on how to improve the data world!) Here are some examples of opportunities I have recently been involved with:

* I had the chance to plunge into the world of "{% include link.html url=["mailto:info@bco-dmo.org](https://datacarpentry.org/)" text="The Carpentries" external=true %}", developing and teaching workshops on the fundamental software and data skills needed to conduct research.
* On another occasion, BCO-DMO collaborated with the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). We guided undergraduate college professors through 'Databytes', which are packaged data exploration and analysis modules they can adapt and use in their courses at their home institutions.
* Yet for another opportunity, I sat on a panel at a "career day" for eighth graders, inspiring (hopefully) students to realize the importance of data.
