If you've submitted data to BCO-DMO before, you might be familiar with the process: 

download a metadata .rtf form, 

fill in the form, 

save the form, and then 

attach it to an email to {% include link.html url="mailto:info@bco-dmo.org" text="info@bco-dmo.org" external=true %} with your data files. 

This process has served our community well, but we know you may have occasionally encourntered challenges when submitting data this way. Perhaps you've had the experience of filling in a form and forgetting to save it! Or perhaps you've had trouble with your email clients when trying to send messages with many attachments. Over time, and after many research projects and many data submissions, it may even be difficult for you to keep track of what data you've submitted to BCO-DMO. 

To help streamline the process, we are **pleased to announce the launch of our new online submission tool!** This new tool will offically launch during the {% include link.html url="https://web.whoi.edu/ocb-workshop/" text="OCB Summer Workshop" external=true %} on June 20-23, 2022. 

Our new submission tool provides an interface you can access in your browser to submit data to and register new projects with BCO-DMO. We've added many features to enhance the user experience of data submission, including the ability to save your progress, work on your submission with collaborators, and view the real-time status of your submissions. This tool helps you keep track of your submissions by displaying all of the previous datasets and projects on which you are a contributor so you can see which ones are in progress and which ones are complete. 

If the old process is working well for you, you can continue to submit data by email, but we encourage you to try out the new tool to see if it improves your workflow. In upcoming blog posts, we'll explore the features of the online submission tool in more detail, providing step-by-step how-tos. However, the tool has plenty of built-in instructions and guidance that make it intuitive for you to use on your next submission. To get you started, here are some basics:

**_Login:_** When you navigate to the submission tool, you'll be prompted to login with your ORCiD. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up at {% include link.html url="https://orcid.org/" text="https://orcid.org/" external=true %}. If your ORCiD is linked to your institutional email, you will have the option to sign in via your institution.

{% include image.html id="submit_tool_login_screen_orcid" position="right" %}

**_Once logged in, you'll see two options:_** "Create a new dataset" and "Register a new project".

**_Describe your dataset or project:_** After selecting one of those two options, you'll be guided through a series of metadata fields where you can enter the relevant information.
{% include image.html id="submit_tool_dataset_entry" position="right" %}

**_Add files:_** On the last step, you upload your files and hit "Submit"! You also have the option to save a draft that will capture your progress.


Once submitted, you'll receive an automated confirmation email. Soon after, a BCO-DMO data manager will review your submission and provide further details by email on the next steps.
