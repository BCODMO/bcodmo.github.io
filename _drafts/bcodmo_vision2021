<!Welcome to the BCO-DMO Revolution> Welcome to our quiet revolution. When the BCO-DMO data repository was founded in 2006, it was somewhat of an arranged 
marriage and a novel experiment for the time: combine two existing, well-functioning, data management offices from two different, long-standing, oceanographic 
research programs with a goal of gaining an economy of scale for NSF OCEâ€™s data management needs. Turns out- it worked incredibly well. The BCO-DMO project 
team has been successfully collaborating with the oceanographic community ever since to help share its research output. An activity that has created a rich 
collection of marine and related data and information available for reuse in new scientific research.
